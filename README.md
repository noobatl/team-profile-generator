## DESCRIPTION
 
As a manager, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I can have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.
As a team member, we built this project to be able to render the teams information for easy access in a website. 
The team profile generator makes it easy to compile a list of employee information in one easy to access website.
We learned the ability to use inquirer in multiple ways to not only ask important employee info, but to ask different questions depending on the employees role. 
Our project stands out from the rest because it uses a set of js files and test files to make sure the cli continues to work correctly.
